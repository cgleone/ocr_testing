MRI examination of the right shoulder reveals marrow signal intensity be unremarkable without
evidence of acute fracture or bony contusion. The acromioclavicular joint space is diminished
and slightly edematous with bony hypertrophic changes at the superior and inferior aspects of the
articular margins narrowing the subacromial arch. The glenohumeral joint space is narrowed
with denuding of the articular cartilage. Bony hypertrophy is present at the medial aspect of the
humeral articular surface.

The supraspinatus tendon is attenuated with adjacent fluid and a focus of signal alteration at the
musculotendinous junction. The inferior margin is ragged in appearance. There is an alteration of
fluid and irregular margin at the distal aspect of the subscapularis tendon (Series #102, instance
#13). The subscapular bursa is fluid-filled and greatly enlarged. Fluid signal is also identified
within the subdeltoid/subacromial bursa. The sheath of the long head of the biceps tendon is
greatly enlarged and fluid-filled, exceeding 21 mm in transverse diameter. The sheath is
attenuated and its integrity is questionable, anteromedially (series #102, instance #18). The
glenoid labrum appears intact, however if a glenolabral tear is clinically suspected, magnetic
resonance arthrography is recommended for a more thorough evaluation. There is fluid signal
within the glenohumeral joint cavity
