Patient: XXXXX XXXXX

Date of Birth: X-XX-XXK

Date of Examination: 2-A-16

Date of Report: 2-6-16

Referring Physician: Dr. XXXXX

Examination: Videofluoroscopic Evaluation of the Cervical Spine
CERVICAL SPINE:

Standard fluoroscopic views of the cervical spine performed by Health Solutions, Inc are
submitted for evaluation. Sagittal alignment demonstrates toss of the normal cervical
lordosis with posterior carriage of the head. The intervertebral disc spaces are
maintained. Overall bone density is adequate for the age and Sex of the patient.

NODDING MOTION OF THE UPPER CERVICAL SPINE: Flexion and extension
demonstrate normal intersegmental motion.

 

LATERAL BENDING MOTIONS OF THE UPPER CERVICAL SPINE: During left
lateral bending there is a 3.0 mM lateral translation ‘of G1 upon C2. There is a2.0mm
translation during right lateral bending.

FLEXION AND EXTENSION MOTIONS OF THE LOWER CERVICAL SPINE:

Flexion: During flexion, there jisai.omm anterior transiation of C3, C4 and C5.
Extension: Extension demonstrates 3 2.0mm posterior transtation of C3, C4 and C5.

FLEXION AND EXTENSION MOTIONS IN THE OBLIQUE PROJECTION: During
flexion and extension, there is contiguous motion of the facets with patency of the
intervertebral foramina.

LATERAL BENDING MOTION OF THE LOWER CERVICAL SPINE: Right lateral
bending is restricted at the C5-C7 levels.

ROTATION MOTIONS OF THE LOWER CERVICAL SPINE: Left and right rotation
demonstrate normal intersegmental motion.
